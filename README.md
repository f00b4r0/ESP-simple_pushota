#  ESP-IDF simple push OTA component

A standalone component for ESP-IDF that adds basic push OTA capability to your project.

This component is geared toward development stages, it is definitely **not production ready**,
if only because the update is not even password-protected. It leverages the ESP "app_update" routines.

I use it when developing new ESP apps and so I make it available to others as-is,
with no warranty of any kind :)

It enables quick and easy remote flashing of a device under development.

This component supports (and has been successfully tested with) both **ESP8266** and **ESP32**.

## Usage

### Integration with your project

* Drop this component in your project's `components` folder
* run `idf.py menuconfig`
* Set the partition table to allow OTA (using e.g. "Factory + 2 OTA partitions")
* Under Components config:
  * In LwIP, enable `SO_REUSEADDR` support
  * In simple_pushota set the desired listen port

Add the `simple_pushota.h` include and simply call `pushota()` in your project to launch the listener.

The function will block and wait for an update.
Thus it can either be called as needed (triggered from another part of the project when enabling OTA is wanted,
suspending code execution), or it can run as a separate thread, always available (in which case special attention
must be paid to concurrent threads execution during the OTA process).

The component needs approximately 2320 bytes of stack for its operation (on ESP8266).

### Flashing OTA

When `pushota()` has been called, it will block and listen on the configured listen port for an incoming HTTP POST request.
The payload is the firmware image.

In simple words, using [curl](https://curl.se):

* Build your project using `idf.py build`
* Execute e.g. `curl <esphost>:<OTA_PORT> --data-binary @build/<project>.bin`

Where:

* `<esphost>` is your device's IP address
* `<OTA_PORT>` is the configured OTA listen port
* `<project>` is your project name

A successful flash will be greeted with a 200 OK response and the next OTA boot partition will be sent in the reply content,
otherwise an error will be reported to the client. 

It is possible to abort a call to `pushota()` without flashing by sending an HTTP DELETE request using e.g.
`curl <esphost>:<OTA_PORT> -X DELETE`

## Implementation details

The system is very crude, it provides just enough HTTP glue for a basic HTTP client to be able to upload the new firmware binary.

It accepts a single connection (for obvious reasons): once a connection has been established,
subsequent ones will be denied until the process completes.

The code will check that a payload length is provided in the request headers,
and that the upload content is actually at least the same length as what was specified in the POST request.
Integrity checks are "delegated" to the underlying app_update subsystem,  

Upon success `pushota()` will return `ESP_OK`, at which point it is typically safe to call `esp_restart()` to boot into the new firmware.

If the operation is aborted through an HTTP DELETE request, `pushota()` does not touch the flash and exits successfully with `ESP_OK`.

## Example code

### Standalone

```c
int app_main(void)
{
	bool wantota;
	
	/* ... */
	
	if (wantota) {
		ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Starting OTA");
		ret = pushota();	// will block
		if (!ret)
			esp_restart();
	}
}
```

### In separate thread
```c
static void pushota_task(void *pvParameter)
{
	pushota();
	esp_restart();	// always restart when pushota() returns
}

int app_main(void)
{
	/* ... */
	
	ret = xTaskCreate(&pushota_task, "ota", 2560, NULL, 2, NULL);
	if (ret != pdPASS)
		ESP_LOGE(TAG, "Failed to create pushota task");
}
```
